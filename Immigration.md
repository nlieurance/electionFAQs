#### Q. Do Democrats want illegal immigrants to vote in federal elections?

No, Democrats do not want illegal immigrants to vote in federal elections. This is a misconception often propagated for political purposes. The facts are:

1. It is already illegal for noncitizens, including illegal immigrants, to vote in federal elections[1][2].
2. Democratic lawmakers have consistently affirmed that they do not support allowing noncitizens to vote in federal elections[1][3].
3. Recent Democratic proposals related to voting have focused on language accessibility for citizens, not on extending voting rights to noncitizens[1].
4. While some localities allow noncitizen voting in local elections, this does not extend to federal elections, which remain restricted to U.S. citizens[2][4].
5. Claims of widespread noncitizen voting in federal elections are unsupported by evidence, with studies showing only rare, isolated incidents[2][3].

The narrative that Democrats want illegal immigrants to vote in federal elections appears to be a political talking point rather than a factual representation of Democratic policy positions or legislative efforts.

#### Q. Does an increase in illegal immigrants result in an increase in congressional representatives?

The number of representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives is capped at 435. However, the distribution of these seats among the states is based on population counts from the U.S. Census, which includes all residents regardless of citizenship status. Here are the key points:

1. **Fixed Number of Representatives**: The total number of House seats has been fixed at 435 since 1929[2].
2. **Population-Based Apportionment**: Seats are apportioned based on the total population of each state as determined by the decennial census, which includes illegal immigrants[2][4].
3. **Impact on Representation**: States with larger populations, including illegal immigrants, can gain more representatives, while states with smaller populations can lose representatives[2][4].
4. **Legislative Efforts**: There have been legislative efforts, such as the Equal Representation Act, to exclude illegal immigrants from the apportionment count, arguing that it distorts political representation and Electoral College votes[3][4][5].
5. **Controversy**: The inclusion of illegal immigrants in the census count for apportionment purposes is controversial, with some arguing it provides an incentive for states to attract more immigrants to gain political power[3][4][5].

==Thus, while the total number of representatives remains the same, the presence of illegal immigrants can influence how those seats are distributed among the states.==

#### Q. Does an increase in illegal immigrants result in an increase in electoral votes for Democrats?

The impact of illegal immigration on electoral votes for Democrats is relatively minor and often overstated. Key points:

1. Illegal immigrants are counted in the census, which affects House seat apportionment and Electoral College votes.
2. Studies estimate the redistribution impact is small, around 3-4 seats in recent years[1][2].
3. The partisan effect is not significantly skewed; both Republican and Democratic states can gain or lose seats[1].
4. The overall impact on presidential elections has been negligible historically[1].
5. Illegal immigrants cannot vote in federal elections, so their direct electoral impact is limited[4].

While illegal immigration does influence apportionment to some degree, its effect on electoral votes for Democrats is not as substantial as sometimes claimed. The redistribution of seats tends to balance out between states with different political leanings[1][2].

#### Q. Why are some cities letting illegal immigrants vote?

Some cities in the United States allow noncitizens, including undocumented immigrants, to vote in local elections. ==This practice is intended to enable residents who contribute to the community to have a say in local governance, particularly on issues that directly affect them, such as school board decisions.== Examples include cities in California, Maryland, Vermont, and Washington, D.C.[1][2][3][4].

Key points include:

- **Local Focus**: Noncitizen voting is limited to local elections, such as city council or school board elections, and does not extend to federal or state elections[2][3].
- **Historical Context**: Noncitizen voting was more common in the U.S. until the 1920s, when nativist sentiments led to its decline[3].
- **Legal and Political Challenges**: These measures often face legal challenges and political opposition, particularly from Republican lawmakers who argue it undermines the integrity of elections[1][3][4].
- **Low Turnout**: Voter turnout among noncitizens tends to be low due to concerns about legal repercussions and deportation[3][4].

Overall, the allowance of noncitizen voting in some local elections reflects an effort to include all community members in local decision-making processes, despite significant controversy and opposition.

#### Q. Why do Democrats oppose laws that ban non-citizens from voting?

Democrats generally do not oppose laws that ban non-citizens from voting in federal elections, as such bans already exist and are widely supported. However, they often oppose new legislation on this topic for several reasons:

1. **Redundancy:** Federal law already prohibits non-citizens from voting in federal elections[4]. Democrats argue that additional laws are unnecessary and potentially confusing.
2. **Voter suppression concerns:** Some Democrats worry that overly strict citizenship verification requirements could inadvertently disenfranchise eligible U.S. citizens, particularly young voters or those who may have difficulty producing certain documents[5].
3. **Local autonomy:** Democrats often support the right of local jurisdictions to determine their own voting policies for local elections[2][3].
4. **Focus on other priorities:** They argue that efforts to pass new non-citizen voting bans distract from more pressing election issues.
5. **Political messaging:** Some Democrats view these efforts as part of a broader Republican strategy to stoke fears about immigration and election integrity rather than addressing real problems[2][5].

It's important to note that Democrats do not generally advocate for non-citizens voting in federal elections, but rather oppose what they see as unnecessary or potentially harmful legislation on the issue.

#### Q. Do immigrants from China and other countries want to sabotage democracy? 

No, there is no evidence that immigrants from China or other countries are coming to the United States to sabotage democracy. The available information suggests:

1. Most Chinese immigrants are fleeing economic hardship, political repression, or seeking better opportunities[1][2].
2. Many are risking dangerous journeys and paying large sums of money to come to the U.S., motivated by a desire for work and a better life[2].
3. Claims of Chinese immigrants forming a "military-age army" or engaging in coordinated efforts to undermine democracy are unfounded and not supported by evidence[2][5].
4. Experts warn that such rhetoric can fuel discrimination and violence against Asian Americans[2].
5. While some localities allow noncitizen voting in local elections, federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections[3][4].
6. The increase in Chinese immigration is seen by some experts as a soft power opportunity for the U.S., as it demonstrates people choosing the American system over China's[5].

In summary, immigrants generally come seeking safety, freedom, and economic opportunities, not to sabotage democratic institutions. Claims to the contrary appear to be political rhetoric rather than factual assessments.

#### Q. Is Kamala Harris in charge of the southern border of the United States?

#border-wall

No, Kamala Harris is not in charge of the southern border of the United States. Her role has been mischaracterized and exaggerated. Key points:

1. Harris was tasked with addressing the "root causes" of migration from Central America, particularly Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.
2. Her focus was on diplomatic efforts and economic development in those countries to reduce migration pressures.
3. She was never officially named "border czar" or put in charge of border security or policy.
4. Border security and enforcement remain under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security.
5. Harris's role was more limited and focused on long-term diplomatic and economic strategies in Central America, not day-to-day border operations.
6. The characterization of Harris as being "in charge of the border" appears to be a political talking point rather than an accurate description of her responsibilities.

#### Q. Did Donald Trump build the border wall he promised?

#border-wall #Trump 

Donald Trump did not fully build the border wall he promised during his 2016 campaign. Key points:

1. Trump originally promised a concrete wall spanning 1,000 miles of the 2,000-mile border, paid for by Mexico.
2. By the end of his term, about 452 miles of barrier had been constructed or replaced.
3. Only about 80 miles of this was new barrier where none previously existed.
4. Most construction (about 350 miles) replaced or reinforced existing barriers.
5. The majority of the new barriers are steel bollard fencing, not a concrete wall.
6. Mexico did not pay for the wall. Funding came from U.S. government sources, including diverted military funds.
7. Trump fell short of his revised goal to build 450 miles of new wall by the end of 2020.

While Trump made significant progress on border barrier construction, the final result differed substantially from his initial campaign promises in terms of length, material, and funding source.
