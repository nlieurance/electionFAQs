#### Q. What did the economy look like under Trump compared to Biden?

#Trump #Biden 

The economies under Trump and Biden show both similarities and stark contrasts:

1. **Economic Growth:** Both presidents oversaw periods of robust growth. When adjusted for inflation, GDP grew by 8.4% under Biden compared to 6.8% under Trump (including the pandemic year). Excluding 2020, their annualized growth rates were similar, with Biden slightly ahead at 2.9% versus Trump's 2.7%[1][4].
2. **Inflation:** This is a key differentiator. Under Biden, inflation has been significantly higher, with prices rising over 19% since he took office. In contrast, prices only increased about 5% during a similar period under Trump[4].
3. **Job Market:** Both presidents can claim strong labor markets. Biden's tenure has seen the addition of 15.7 million jobs, with unemployment reaching a 53-year low. Trump's pre-pandemic job market was also strong, but his term ended with a net loss of jobs due to the COVID-19 crisis[4].
4. **Stock Market:** The S&P 500 has risen 42.1% under Biden compared to 33.6% over the same period under Trump. However, stocks rose faster in Trump's second and third years compared to Biden's[5].
5. **Federal Debt:** Trump added significantly more to the national debt ($8.4 trillion over his full term) compared to Biden ($4.3 trillion so far)[5].
6. **Public Perception:** Despite some positive economic indicators under Biden, polls consistently show that voters have more trust in Trump's ability to handle the economy and inflation[4].

In summary, while both administrations can point to economic strengths, Biden's tenure has been marked by strong job growth and stock market performance but tarnished by high inflation. Trump's pre-pandemic economy saw steady growth, low inflation, and strong stock market gains, but ended with significant job losses due to COVID-19. Public perception tends to favor Trump on economic issues, despite mixed data comparisons.
