<br>State-Level Decision: Trump believes abortion rights should be decided by individual states rather than at the federal level[1][3].
<br>Supreme Court Influence: His appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court were pivotal in overturning Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion[1][2][3].
<br>Federal Ban Stance: Trump has stated he would not sign a federal abortion ban but supports states imposing their own restrictions[1][3].
<br>Exceptions: He supports exceptions for abortion in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother's life is at risk[3].
<br>Joe Biden's Position on Abortion<br>
<br>Federal Protection: Biden supports enshrining the right to abortion in federal law, akin to the protections provided by Roe v. Wade before it was overturned[1][2][3].
<br>Legislative Efforts: He has called for a Democratic majority in Congress to pass laws protecting abortion rights and has pledged to veto any federal abortion ban[1][3].
<br>Administrative Actions: In the absence of legislative changes, Biden's administration has taken steps to mitigate the impact of state-level abortion bans, such as protecting abortion patients' medical records and ensuring emergency medical treatment includes necessary abortions[1].
<br>Public Advocacy: Biden has been vocal about restoring Roe v. Wade and has criticized Trump's role in its overturning[3].
<br>Both Trump and Biden have clear, contrasting positions on abortion, reflecting broader ideological divides between their respective parties.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-biden-issues-election.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-biden-issues-election.html</a><br>

Her key positions include:<br>
<br>National Protection: Harris supports legislation to protect the right to abortion nationally, similar to the protections provided by Roe v. Wade before it was overturned in 2022[1][2].
<br>Legislative Actions: As a Senator, she co-sponsored legislation to ban state-level restrictions on abortion and voted against bills that would impose significant limits on abortion rights, such as banning abortions after 20 weeks[2].
<br>Public Advocacy: Harris has been a vocal critic of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and has actively promoted reproductive rights as Vice President, including visiting abortion clinics and making public statements to highlight the issue[1][2][3].
<br>Campaign Focus: Reproductive rights are expected to be a central focus of her campaign if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, with significant support from major abortion rights organizations[4][5].
<br>Harris's consistent support for abortion rights and her proactive stance on the issue make her a prominent advocate for reproductive health and freedom.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/politics/kamala-harris-abortion-immigration-economy-israel.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/politics/kamala-harris-abortion-immigration-economy-israel.html</a><br>

 <br><br><a href=".?query=tag:Trump" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Trump</a> <br>Here are the key points about Trump's attempts to influence the 2020 U.S. Census:<br>
<br>The Trump administration made unprecedented efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census[1][2]. This was seen as an attempt to suppress responses from immigrant communities and alter the population counts used for congressional apportionment[3].
<br>In July 2019, the Supreme Court blocked the addition of the citizenship question, ruling that the administration's stated reasoning for adding it "seems to have been contrived"[4].
<br>After failing to add the citizenship question, Trump issued an executive order in July 2019 instructing federal agencies to share citizenship data with the Census Bureau[3][4].
<br>In July 2020, Trump issued a memorandum seeking to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the census population counts used for congressional apportionment[2][3]. This was unprecedented, as all persons regardless of citizenship status had been included in these counts since 1790[3].
<br>The Trump administration also tried to cut the census count short and speed up the delivery of results, which was seen as an attempt to control the apportionment process before leaving office if Trump lost reelection[5].
<br>Internal documents revealed that the push for citizenship data was part of a secret strategy to alter the population numbers used for congressional apportionment and Electoral College votes in ways that would likely benefit Republicans[4].
<br>Career officials at the Census Bureau raised concerns about the "unprecedented" level of engagement from political appointees in technical matters related to the census[5].
<br>These actions were widely criticized as attempts to manipulate the census for political gain, potentially undermining its constitutional purpose of counting all persons in the United States[1][3][4].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/documents-reveal-trump-administrations-unprecedented-attempts-influence" target="_blank">https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/documents-reveal-trump-administrations-unprecedented-attempts-influence</a><br>

Trump's civil rights record includes actions and statements that have been widely criticized, such as attempting to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., defending Confederate statues, and ending racial sensitivity training in federal agencies[5].

Here are the key points:<br>
<br>In December 2022, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social suggesting the termination of the Constitution in response to his claims of election fraud[1][4].
<br>Trump wrote: "A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution"[1][4].
<br>This statement was made in the context of Trump's continued false claims about the 2020 election being stolen from him[3][4].
<br>Trump's comments drew criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, with the White House calling the remarks "anathema to the soul of our nation"[4].
<br>Republican Rep. Liz Cheney denounced Trump's statement, saying "No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution"[4].
<br>After facing backlash, Trump attempted to deny that he had called for terminating the Constitution, claiming it was "DISINFORMATION &amp; LIES" spread by the media[5].
<br>Despite his denial, Trump's original post explicitly mentioning the "termination" of constitutional articles remained visible on his Truth Social platform[3][4].
<br>This incident highlighted Trump's continued promotion of election denialism and raised concerns about his respect for democratic institutions and the rule of law.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/9-out-of-10-republicans-silent-on-trumps-calls-to-terminate-the-constitution/" target="_blank">https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/9-out-of-10-republicans-silent-on-trumps-calls-to-terminate-the-constitution/</a><br>

<br>Business Practices:

<br>Trump has a long history of shady business practices, including accusations of not paying contractors and workers, housing discrimination, and illegal financial maneuvers[2].
<br>Investigations have exposed corruption, conflicts of interest, and money laundering in various Trump business deals, such as those in Panama and the Dominican Republic[4].


<br>Charitable and Educational Scams:

<br>Trump University was involved in a fraud trial, and the Trump Foundation faced scrutiny for its questionable practices[2].


<br>Criminal Cases:

<br>Trump faces multiple criminal charges, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S., obstructing an official proceeding, and mishandling classified documents[3].


<br>Political Exploitation:

<br>Scholars argue that Trump's administration was marked by exploitation of political power for personal gain, including stacking courts and repressing opponents[5].


<br>Joe Biden: Evidence of Corruption<br>
<br>Hunter Biden's Business Dealings:

<br>Allegations have been made regarding Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China, with claims that Joe Biden was involved or benefited. However, investigations have not conclusively proven Joe Biden's direct involvement or corruption.


<br>Republican Investigations:

<br>Congressional Republicans have launched investigations into Biden's actions during his vice presidency, particularly regarding Ukraine. These investigations are ongoing and have yet to produce definitive evidence of corruption.


<br>Public Perception and Political Attacks:

<br>Biden has faced political attacks accusing him of corruption, but these claims often lack substantiated evidence and are part of broader partisan disputes.


<br>Summary<br>While there is substantial evidence and multiple investigations supporting claims of corruption against Donald Trump, including criminal charges and documented unethical business practices, the evidence against Joe Biden primarily revolves around allegations related to his son's business activities, which have not been conclusively proven.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Proof-Corruption-Bribery-Impeachment-Pandemic/dp/1250272998" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Proof-Corruption-Bribery-Impeachment-Pandemic/dp/1250272998</a><br>

Making such a claim without evidence would be spreading misinformation. Here are the key points from the reliable sources provided:<br>
<br>COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly, leading to lockdowns and economic disruptions within China.
<br>The pandemic severely impacted China's own economy, causing declining consumption, production, and overall economic growth. This suggests China was also negatively affected, rather than benefiting from the virus.
<br>China implemented strict "Zero-COVID" policies to control the spread, which further hampered its economic recovery.
<br>The pandemic disrupted global supply chains and international trade, affecting China's trade relationships with partners like the US and Japan.
<br>China engaged in "vaccine diplomacy" efforts, but these were not always effective and the US ultimately donated more vaccines globally.
<br>In summary, the available information indicates COVID-19 was a public health crisis that negatively impacted China along with the rest of the world. There is no evidence provided to support claims of intentional release or political motivations behind the outbreak. <br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.usglc.org/coronavirus/china/" target="_blank">https://www.usglc.org/coronavirus/china/</a><br>

While both parties have different approaches to education policy, studies show that when controlling for demographic and economic factors, partisan differences in educational outcomes largely disappear.

Here are the key points:<br>
<br>Increasing book removals: There has been a significant increase in books being removed from school libraries and classrooms, with PEN America reporting 1,477 instances of book prohibitions in the first half of the 2022-23 academic year, up 28.5% from the previous semester[2][4].
<br>Republican-led legislation: Many of these book removals are spurred by legislation pushed by conservative officials in Republican-led states. For example, Missouri lawmakers made it illegal to provide students with "sexually explicit" material, leading to the removal of hundreds of books from school libraries[5].
<br>Target of removals: The books being removed often focus on race, racism, LGBTQ+ themes, or include characters of color. About 30% of removed books are about race or include characters of color, while 26% have LGBTQ+ characters or themes[5].
<br>Republican arguments: Some Republicans argue that these books are not being "banned" because they can still be purchased elsewhere, such as on Amazon. They contend that removing books from school libraries is within local communities' rights and is about protecting children from "explicit content"[2].
<br>Democratic opposition: Democrats generally oppose these book removals, characterizing them as censorship and arguing that they are being driven by a vocal minority pushing a personal agenda[2].
<br>Public opinion: Interestingly, a recent NPR/Ipsos poll showed that about half of Republicans (51%) oppose state lawmakers passing laws to ban certain books and remove them from classrooms and libraries[1].
<br>Organized efforts: Book removals are increasingly powered by organized groups, elected leaders, and legislation, rather than just concerned parents[5].

<br>Economic Management:

<br>Trump: Advocates argue that Trump managed the economy effectively before the pandemic, with significant job growth, tax cuts, and deregulation policies that boosted business confidence.
<br>Harris: Critics may view Harris as less experienced in economic management and potentially more inclined toward progressive policies that could increase regulation and taxes.


<br>Immigration Policies:

<br>Trump: Known for his strict immigration policies, including building the border wall and implementing travel bans, which appeal to voters concerned about illegal immigration and national security.
<br>Harris: Seen as more lenient on immigration, which some voters might perceive as potentially leading to weaker border security.


<br>Foreign Policy:

<br>Trump: Advocated for an "America First" foreign policy, emphasizing national sovereignty, renegotiating trade deals, and reducing U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts.
<br>Harris: Expected to continue Biden's more traditional foreign policy approach, which some voters might view as less assertive and more prone to international entanglements.


<br>Judicial Appointments:

<br>Trump: Appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices, which appeals to voters who prioritize a conservative judiciary.
<br>Harris: Likely to appoint more liberal judges, which may concern conservative voters.


<br>Law and Order:

<br>Trump: Emphasizes a strong stance on law and order, appealing to voters worried about crime and public safety.
<br>Harris: While she has a background as a prosecutor, some voters might view her as more progressive on criminal justice reform, potentially leading to perceptions of being softer on crime.


<br>Regulation and Business Environment:

<br>Trump: Promoted deregulation, which supporters argue helps businesses thrive and boosts economic growth.
<br>Harris: Expected to support more regulatory policies, which some voters might see as burdensome to businesses.


<br>Age and Experience:

<br>Trump: Despite being older, Trump is seen by his supporters as experienced and energetic.
<br>Harris: While younger, some voters might question her experience and readiness for the presidency compared to Trump.


<br>Voter Enthusiasm and Base:

<br>Trump: Has a highly energized and loyal base, which could be crucial in a tight election.
<br>Harris: Faces the challenge of uniting and energizing the Democratic base, especially given the mixed perceptions about her.


<br>These arguments reflect the contrasting policy priorities and leadership styles of Trump and Harris, with Trump emphasizing a more conservative, nationalist approach and Harris expected to continue Biden's more progressive, multilateral policies.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2024-07-25/kamala-harris-strategy-decisions-running-mate-electoral-college-counter-republican-trump-attacks-politics" target="_blank">https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2024-07-25/kamala-harris-strategy-decisions-running-mate-electoral-college-counter-republican-trump-attacks-politics</a><br>

Here are the key points:<br>
<br>Election officials use rigorous verification processes to validate mail ballots before counting them [1][2].
<br>Mail-in voting has been successfully used in the United States for many years without evidence of widespread fraud [2].
<br>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) notes that while mail-in voting does introduce some risks, these can be managed through various policies, procedures, and controls [3].
<br>Experts say there is minimal risk of increased voter fraud with mail-in voting [5].
<br>Mail-in ballots (also known as absentee ballots) have long been part of a robust election security system in the U.S. [4].
<br>Several states have conducted elections entirely by mail in the past without major issues [5].
<br>There is a partisan divide on this issue, with Republicans more likely to view mail-in voting as problematic for voter fraud compared to Democrats [5].
<br>While some concerns exist, election officials, media, and other organizations are working to educate voters about the mail voting process and set appropriate expectations [3].
<br>In summary, while no voting system is without risks, the evidence from reliable sources suggests that mail-in voting is generally safe and secure when proper procedures are followed. The perception of mail-in voting safety has become politicized, leading to differing views among the public despite expert assessments of its security.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/mail-voting-is-safe-secure/" target="_blank">https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/mail-voting-is-safe-secure/</a><br>

<br>Prevalence: Approximately 21% of Americans, or about 52 million people, participate in major means-tested government assistance programs each month[4]. About two-thirds of all Americans will use welfare for at least six months at some point between the ages of 20 and 65[1].
<br>Racial demographics: The majority of welfare recipients are white (43%), followed by Hispanic (26%), and Black (23%)[2]. This distribution aligns with the broader population demographics, debunking the myth that welfare programs are predominantly used by Black people.
<br>Common Myths and Realities<br>
<br>Myth: Welfare recipients are lazy: Most welfare programs require recipients to work. For example, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program mandates that single parents must work at least 30 hours a week, and two-parent families must work between 35 and 50 hours a week[4].
<br>Myth: Welfare payments are too high: Welfare programs provide minimal assistance. For instance, the average benefit per person under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is $1.50 per meal[4].
<br>Myth: Undocumented immigrants are on welfare: Undocumented immigrants are generally not eligible for welfare benefits, except for emergency Medicaid[4].
<br>Myth: Welfare recipients use benefits for drugs: Drug use among welfare recipients is similar to or lower than the general population. For example, in Tennessee, less than 1% of welfare applicants tested positive for illegal drugs in 2014[4].
<br>Economic Impact and Effectiveness<br>
<br>Poverty reduction: Welfare programs have been effective in reducing poverty. Social Security, for example, moved more than 26 million people out of poverty in 2021[3]. Similarly, COVID-19 relief payments helped nearly 9 million individuals avoid poverty in the same year[3].
<br>Employment and welfare: Many welfare recipients are employed but earn low wages. Companies like Walmart and McDonald's are top employers of individuals enrolled in welfare programs[3]. In 2021, 51% of adults receiving SNAP benefits worked at least 35 hours a week for nearly the entire year[3].
<br>Historical Context and Stereotypes<br>
<br>Historical stigmatization: The term "welfare" has been racialized, often associated with Black people despite white Americans benefiting more from government assistance[1]. The "welfare queen" stereotype, popularized in the 1970s, inaccurately depicts Black women as exploiting the system, although data shows that welfare fraud is not widespread and is not confined to any single racial group[2].
<br>Gender and welfare: Women, particularly single mothers, have historically been stigmatized as welfare recipients. However, the birthrate among women on welfare is lower than the national average, contradicting the myth that they have more children to receive more benefits[1].
<br>Conclusion<br>Welfare programs in the United States serve a significant portion of the population, cutting across various demographics. Despite common myths, these programs are crucial for reducing poverty and providing necessary support to low-income families. The stereotypes associated with welfare recipients are largely unfounded and contribute to the stigmatization of those in need.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/from-mothers-pensions-to-welfare-queens-debunking-myths-about-welfare/" target="_blank">https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/from-mothers-pensions-to-welfare-queens-debunking-myths-about-welfare/</a><br>

<br>Lower emissions: EVs produce significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime compared to gas vehicles, even when accounting for electricity generation. A medium-sized EV produces 60-68% fewer lifetime greenhouse gas emissions than a gas-powered car[1].
<br>Improved air quality: EVs have zero tailpipe emissions, reducing local air pollution from nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulate matter[3].
<br>Reduced noise pollution: Electric vehicles are much quieter than gas-powered cars, helping to decrease noise pollution in urban areas[3].
<br>Less harmful fluids: EVs don't require motor oil changes or other toxic fluids associated with gas engines, reducing the risk of environmental contamination[2].
<br>Lower brake dust: Regenerative braking systems in EVs reduce brake dust emissions, which contribute to air pollution[2].
<br>Potential for cleaner energy sources: As electricity grids incorporate more renewable energy, the environmental benefits of EVs will continue to increase[1][3].
<br>While there are some environmental concerns related to battery production and disposal, the overall impact of EVs is still significantly better than that of gas-powered vehicles. As battery technology improves and recycling processes advance, these concerns are likely to diminish further[4].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://vitalsigns.edf.org/story/yes-electric-vehicles-are-better-environment-and-answers-more-questions-about-evs" target="_blank">https://vitalsigns.edf.org/story/yes-electric-vehicles-are-better-environment-and-answers-more-questions-about-evs</a><br>

<br>He has repeatedly criticized NATO and expressed frustration with the alliance, famously saying "I don't give a shit about NATO"[3].
<br>He has consistently pressured NATO allies to increase their defense spending, viewing many European countries as not paying their fair share[2][4].
<br>While president, Trump reportedly discussed pulling the U.S. out of NATO multiple times, but was talked out of it by advisers[1][3].
<br>In a recent interview, Trump stated he would "100 percent" remain in NATO if European countries "play fair" and increase their financial contributions[5].
<br>However, experts and former officials, like John Bolton, warn that in a potential second term, Trump might seriously pursue withdrawal from NATO[2][3].
<br>Trump's recent comments suggesting he wouldn't defend NATO allies who don't meet spending targets have reignited concerns about his commitment to the alliance[2][4].
<br>In summary, while Trump has not explicitly stated he wants to withdraw from NATO, his actions and statements suggest he is deeply skeptical of the alliance and might consider withdrawal if European allies don't meet his demands for increased spending.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html</a><br>

 <br><br>Yes, Donald Trump actively encouraged Republicans to oppose a bipartisan border security bill that was being negotiated in the Senate. He publicly criticized the deal before it was even released and privately lobbied GOP lawmakers to reject it, arguing that passing such legislation would give President Biden a political win in an election year[1][3][4].

This is a misconception often propagated for political purposes. The facts are:<br>
<br>It is already illegal for noncitizens, including illegal immigrants, to vote in federal elections[1][2].
<br>Democratic lawmakers have consistently affirmed that they do not support allowing noncitizens to vote in federal elections[1][3].
<br>Recent Democratic proposals related to voting have focused on language accessibility for citizens, not on extending voting rights to noncitizens[1].
<br>While some localities allow noncitizen voting in local elections, this does not extend to federal elections, which remain restricted to U.S. citizens[2][4].
<br>Claims of widespread noncitizen voting in federal elections are unsupported by evidence, with studies showing only rare, isolated incidents[2][3].
<br>The narrative that Democrats want illegal immigrants to vote in federal elections appears to be a political talking point rather than a factual representation of Democratic policy positions or legislative efforts.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-elections-voting-noncitizens-immigration-032459547370" target="_blank">https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-elections-voting-noncitizens-immigration-032459547370</a><br>

However, the distribution of these seats among the states is based on population counts from the U.S. Census, which includes all residents regardless of citizenship status. Here are the key points:<br>
<br>Fixed Number of Representatives: The total number of House seats has been fixed at 435 since 1929[2].
<br>Population-Based Apportionment: Seats are apportioned based on the total population of each state as determined by the decennial census, which includes illegal immigrants[2][4].
<br>Impact on Representation: States with larger populations, including illegal immigrants, can gain more representatives, while states with smaller populations can lose representatives[2][4].
<br>Legislative Efforts: There have been legislative efforts, such as the Equal Representation Act, to exclude illegal immigrants from the apportionment count, arguing that it distorts political representation and Electoral College votes[3][4][5].
<br>Controversy: The inclusion of illegal immigrants in the census count for apportionment purposes is controversial, with some arguing it provides an incentive for states to attract more immigrants to gain political power[3][4][5].
<br>Thus, while the total number of representatives remains the same, the presence of illegal immigrants can influence how those seats are distributed among the states.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member" target="_blank">https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member</a><br>

Key points:<br>
<br>Illegal immigrants are counted in the census, which affects House seat apportionment and Electoral College votes.
<br>Studies estimate the redistribution impact is small, around 3-4 seats in recent years[1][2].
<br>The partisan effect is not significantly skewed; both Republican and Democratic states can gain or lose seats[1].
<br>The overall impact on presidential elections has been negligible historically[1].
<br>Illegal immigrants cannot vote in federal elections, so their direct electoral impact is limited[4].
<br>While illegal immigration does influence apportionment to some degree, its effect on electoral votes for Democrats is not as substantial as sometimes claimed. The redistribution of seats tends to balance out between states with different political leanings[1][2].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/03/elon-musk-overstates-partisan-impact-of-illegal-immigration-on-house-apportionment/" target="_blank">https://www.factcheck.org/2024/03/elon-musk-overstates-partisan-impact-of-illegal-immigration-on-house-apportionment/</a><br>

This practice is intended to enable residents who contribute to the community to have a say in local governance, particularly on issues that directly affect them, such as school board decisions. Examples include cities in California, Maryland, Vermont, and Washington, D.C.[1][2][3][4].<br>Key points include:<br>
<br>Local Focus: Noncitizen voting is limited to local elections, such as city council or school board elections, and does not extend to federal or state elections[2][3].
<br>Historical Context: Noncitizen voting was more common in the U.S. until the 1920s, when nativist sentiments led to its decline[3].
<br>Legal and Political Challenges: These measures often face legal challenges and political opposition, particularly from Republican lawmakers who argue it undermines the integrity of elections[1][3][4].
<br>Low Turnout: Voter turnout among noncitizens tends to be low due to concerns about legal repercussions and deportation[3][4].
<br>Overall, the allowance of noncitizen voting in some local elections reflects an effort to include all community members in local decision-making processes, despite significant controversy and opposition.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/03/14/noncitizens-allowed-to-vote-in-some-local-elections-spurring-backlash-from-gop/" target="_blank">https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/03/14/noncitizens-allowed-to-vote-in-some-local-elections-spurring-backlash-from-gop/</a><br>

However, they often oppose new legislation on this topic for several reasons:<br>
<br>Redundancy: Federal law already prohibits non-citizens from voting in federal elections[4]. Democrats argue that additional laws are unnecessary and potentially confusing.
<br>Voter suppression concerns: Some Democrats worry that overly strict citizenship verification requirements could inadvertently disenfranchise eligible U.S. citizens, particularly young voters or those who may have difficulty producing certain documents[5].
<br>Local autonomy: Democrats often support the right of local jurisdictions to determine their own voting policies for local elections[2][3].
<br>Focus on other priorities: They argue that efforts to pass new non-citizen voting bans distract from more pressing election issues.
<br>Political messaging: Some Democrats view these efforts as part of a broader Republican strategy to stoke fears about immigration and election integrity rather than addressing real problems[2][5].
<br>It's important to note that Democrats do not generally advocate for non-citizens voting in federal elections, but rather oppose what they see as unnecessary or potentially harmful legislation on the issue.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/article_d4b83c7e-3d52-11ef-baac-a3169c50d800.html" target="_blank">https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/article_d4b83c7e-3d52-11ef-baac-a3169c50d800.html</a><br>

The available information suggests:<br>
<br>Most Chinese immigrants are fleeing economic hardship, political repression, or seeking better opportunities[1][2].
<br>Many are risking dangerous journeys and paying large sums of money to come to the U.S., motivated by a desire for work and a better life[2].
<br>Claims of Chinese immigrants forming a "military-age army" or engaging in coordinated efforts to undermine democracy are unfounded and not supported by evidence[2][5].
<br>Experts warn that such rhetoric can fuel discrimination and violence against Asian Americans[2].
<br>While some localities allow noncitizen voting in local elections, federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections[3][4].
<br>The increase in Chinese immigration is seen by some experts as a soft power opportunity for the U.S., as it demonstrates people choosing the American system over China's[5].
<br>In summary, immigrants generally come seeking safety, freedom, and economic opportunities, not to sabotage democratic institutions. Claims to the contrary appear to be political rhetoric rather than factual assessments.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/chinese-migrants-are-coming-us-foot-officials-say-rcna77244" target="_blank">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/chinese-migrants-are-coming-us-foot-officials-say-rcna77244</a><br>

Her role has been mischaracterized and exaggerated. Key points:<br>
<br>Harris was tasked with addressing the "root causes" of migration from Central America, particularly Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.
<br>Her focus was on diplomatic efforts and economic development in those countries to reduce migration pressures.
<br>She was never officially named "border czar" or put in charge of border security or policy.
<br>Border security and enforcement remain under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security.
<br>Harris's role was more limited and focused on long-term diplomatic and economic strategies in Central America, not day-to-day border operations.
<br>The characterization of Harris as being "in charge of the border" appears to be a political talking point rather than an accurate description of her responsibilities.

Key points:<br>
<br>Trump originally promised a concrete wall spanning 1,000 miles of the 2,000-mile border, paid for by Mexico.
<br>By the end of his term, about 452 miles of barrier had been constructed or replaced.
<br>Only about 80 miles of this was new barrier where none previously existed.
<br>Most construction (about 350 miles) replaced or reinforced existing barriers.
<br>The majority of the new barriers are steel bollard fencing, not a concrete wall.
<br>Mexico did not pay for the wall. Funding came from U.S. government sources, including diverted military funds.
<br>Trump fell short of his revised goal to build 450 miles of new wall by the end of 2020.
<br>While Trump made significant progress on border barrier construction, the final result differed substantially from his initial campaign promises in terms of length, material, and funding source.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46748492" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46748492</a><br>

 <br><br><a href=".?query=tag:Trump" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Trump</a> <br>Donald Trump was impeached twice during his presidency.<br>First Impeachment (December 18, 2019):<br>
Trump was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress[1][2]. The charges stemmed from a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump allegedly solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election[1][2]. Specifically, Trump was accused of pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rival Joe Biden and allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, while withholding $400 million in military aid to Ukraine[1][2].<br>Second Impeachment (January 13, 2021):<br>
Trump was impeached for incitement of insurrection[3][4]. This impeachment came in the wake of the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol[3][4]. The House of Representatives charged Trump with encouraging his supporters to commit acts of violence at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election[3][4].<br>In both cases, Trump was ultimately acquitted by the Senate[1][3][4]. However, he became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice[4]. The second impeachment was also notable for being the most bipartisan impeachment in U.S. history, with 10 House Republicans voting in favor of impeachment[3].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S4-4-9/ALDE_00000035/" target="_blank">https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S4-4-9/ALDE_00000035/</a><br>

 <br><br>Based on the search results, several key issues and talking points are emerging in the 2024 U.S. presidential election:<br>
<br><a data-href="Abortion" href="Abortion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abortion</a>: There's a stark divide between Biden and Trump on this issue. Biden advocates for federal abortion protections, while Trump opposes them but now suggests leaving it to the states[3].
<br><a data-href="Immigration" href="Immigration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Immigration</a>: Trump pledges a comprehensive crackdown on illegal immigration, while Biden seeks more tools from Congress to manage the border and create new legal pathways for immigrants[3]
<br>Climate change and energy: Biden has taken significant action on climate change, framing it as a job creation opportunity. Trump's position is less clear from the results, but historically he has been skeptical of climate change policies[1].
<br><a data-href="Economy" href="Economy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Economy</a> and <a data-href="taxes" href="Taxes.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">taxes</a>: The expiration of Trump's 2017 tax cuts is a key issue. Trump wants to extend these cuts, while Biden aims to increase taxes on corporations and high-income earners[3].
<br><a data-href="Healthcare" href="Healthcare.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Healthcare</a>: While specific details aren't provided in the results, this is listed as a major issue[5].

 <br><br><a href=".?query=tag:Fox-News" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Fox-News</a> <br>Fox News is not considered a reliable news source by media experts and researchers[1][2][4]. While it does provide some factual reporting, several studies and analyses have found that Fox News:<br>
<br>Skews heavily to the right in its bias[1][4]
<br>Engages in selective reporting and omission of information that doesn't align with its partisan stance[3][5]
<br>Has viewers who are more likely to hold misconceptions about key political issues compared to viewers of other networks[3]
<br>Blurs the line between news and opinion programming[2][5]
<br>Independent media bias assessments rate Fox News as only "Generally Reliable" with analysis and other issues affecting its credibility[4]. The network has also faced legal consequences for knowingly broadcasting false information[2]. While some individual anchors may be more reliable, overall Fox News is not considered a trustworthy source for unbiased, comprehensive news coverage.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/04/08/five-facts-about-fox-news/" target="_blank">https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/04/08/five-facts-about-fox-news/</a><br>

<br>Internal opposition: Documents revealed through litigation show that top Fox executives, including Rupert Murdoch and board member Paul Ryan, expressed hostility towards Trump after the January 6 attack. Murdoch reportedly aimed to "make Trump a non person" and move on from him[1].
<br>Reduced coverage: There are indications that Fox News has been giving Trump less airtime and attention. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., claimed he hadn't been invited on the network for six months[1].
<br>Debate coverage: Fox News is pitching to secure Republican primary debates without specifically mentioning Trump or DeSantis, suggesting a more neutral stance towards candidates[1].
<br>Criticism from Trump allies: Trump and his supporters have publicly attacked Fox News. Trump called Rupert Murdoch and executives "MAGA hating Globalist RINOS," while others like Stephen K. Bannon have criticized the network[1].
<br>Legal issues coverage: Fox News legal analysts have at times been critical of Trump's legal situations. For example, some commentators questioned the credibility of key witnesses in Trump's hush money trial[3].
<br>Balanced reporting: There are instances where Fox News has presented more balanced or critical views of Trump. For example, they aired criticism from "The View" hosts who called Trump's RNC speech "narcissistic" and "xenophobic"[5].
<br>It's important to note that while there are signs of a strained relationship and occasional criticism, Fox News still provides platforms for Trump supporters and positive coverage of the former president[2][4]. The network appears to be navigating a complex balance between its traditional pro-Trump stance and a desire to maintain broader appeal and credibility.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/08/trump-fox-feud/" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/08/trump-fox-feud/</a><br>

<br>Surveillance, Protest, and Free Speech: The ACLU has outlined potential abuses of executive power in a second Trump administration, including criminalizing dissent, stifling free speech, expanding government surveillance, and targeting political opponents. They have committed to defending First Amendment rights and individual liberties against such threats[3][5].
<br>General Stance: The ACLU has released a series of memos detailing the implications of a potential second Trump administration on various civil rights issues, including immigration, LGBTQ rights, abortion, and voting rights. They emphasize the importance of standing against any executive actions that threaten civil rights and liberties[4].
<br>Overall, the ACLU views Trump's actions and potential future policies as significant threats to civil rights and has pledged to actively oppose these through legal and advocacy efforts.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.aclu.org/publications/trump-on-the-criminal-legal-system" target="_blank">https://www.aclu.org/publications/trump-on-the-criminal-legal-system</a><br>

<br>Progress in some areas:
<br>
<br>Expanded voting rights and abortion protections
<br>Advocated for equal access for transgender individuals
<br>Supported students' right to receive an inclusive education
<br>Issued an executive order promoting access to voting
<br>
<br>Concerns and unfulfilled promises:
<br>
<br>Failed to fully ban racial and other profiling, especially in national security and border contexts
<br>Did not end suspicionless surveillance under FISA Section 702
<br>Has not fully restored the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to its full strength
<br>Has not ended the federal death penalty as promised during his campaign
<br>Implemented new asylum restrictions that the ACLU is challenging in court
<br>
<br>Mixed record on immigration:
<br>
<br>The ACLU sued the Biden administration over new asylum rules that limit asylum processing when border encounters exceed certain thresholds
<br>
<br>Ongoing challenges:
<br>
<br>The ACLU emphasizes the need to hold a potential second Biden administration accountable for protecting abortion rights, preserving the asylum system, safeguarding voting rights, and reforming the criminal legal system
<br>
<br>Overall stance:
<br>
<br>While acknowledging some progress, the ACLU believes the Biden administration "has not fulfilled its critical civil rights and civil liberties responsibilities across a range of issues"
<br>The ACLU maintains that it will continue to use litigation, legislation, advocacy, and grassroots mobilization to ensure the protection of civil rights and liberties, regardless of who wins the upcoming election.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.aclu.org/campaigns-initiatives/the-trump-and-biden-memos" target="_blank">https://www.aclu.org/campaigns-initiatives/the-trump-and-biden-memos</a><br>

<br>Change in stance: Shortly after winning the election, Trump shifted his position, stating he didn't want to "hurt the Clintons" and that Clinton had "suffered greatly"[1][3].
<br>Focus on other priorities: Trump indicated he wanted to concentrate on issues like jobs, healthcare, and immigration rather than prosecuting Clinton[3].
<br>Potential political backlash: Prosecuting a political opponent could have been seen as an abuse of power and faced significant opposition[4].
<br>Legal advice: It was reported that Trump was dissuaded from taking legal action by White House counsel, who warned of potential consequences[4].
<br>Healing and unity: Trump's team framed the decision as an effort to help Clinton "heal" and potentially promote unity after a divisive election[1][3].
<br>Recognition of Justice Department independence: There was acknowledgment that the president shouldn't direct specific investigations, as it would violate the Justice Department's independence[4].

<br>Trump has explicitly threatened to imprison political opponents if he returns to office. He stated it's "very possible" he would have to imprison his rivals, saying "It's a terrible, terrible path they're leading us to, and it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them."[1]
<br>Trump has made numerous threats on social media to use federal agencies like the FBI and Department of Justice to target Joe Biden and other political enemies if he wins a second term. An analysis found at least 25 such threats against Biden alone since 2023, including promises of FBI raids, investigations, indictments and jail time.[3]
<br>During his presidency, Trump reportedly attempted to use government powers against perceived enemies:
<br>
<br>He allegedly asked his chief of staff to have the IRS and other agencies harass FBI officials who investigated his 2016 campaign.[2]
<br>He reportedly wanted to have political opponents like Hillary Clinton and John Brennan audited or investigated.[2]
<br>His administration launched an antitrust investigation into auto companies that opposed his fuel efficiency rollbacks.[2]
<br>He allegedly tried to interfere with the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger as punishment for CNN's coverage.[2]
<br>
<br>Trump has vowed to "root out" and prosecute political opponents he labels as "communists, Marxists, fascists and radical-left thugs", referring to them as "vermin".[2]
<br>He has threatened to prosecute nonprofits and charities supporting immigrants, accusing them of human trafficking.[3]
<br>While some of Trump's most extreme threats were not carried out during his presidency, often due to resistance from officials, he has promised to install more compliant personnel in a potential second term to execute his agenda more effectively.[2][4] These statements and past actions indicate a clear intention to use government power to punish political rivals if given the opportunity.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-floats-imprisoning-political-opponents-rcna155543" target="_blank">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-floats-imprisoning-political-opponents-rcna155543</a><br>

 <br><br>Populism is a political approach that seeks to represent the interests and voices of ordinary people, often contrasting them against a perceived elite or establishment. It typically emphasizes the idea of a struggle between the common populace and a privileged group, advocating for policies that are claimed to benefit the general public. Populism can manifest across the political spectrum, from left-wing to right-wing ideologies, and often includes rhetoric that appeals to the emotions and concerns of the masses.<br><br><br><a href=".?query=tag:Trump" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Trump</a> <br>Donald Trump is often described as a populist candidate due to his rhetorical style and appeal to the "common people" against the perceived elite. His campaign and presidency featured many hallmarks of populism, such as anti-establishment rhetoric, nationalist sentiments, and promises to prioritize the interests of ordinary Americans over those of elites and foreign entities[1][3][4]. <br>However, his actual governance has been critiqued for favoring traditional right-wing policies, such as tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation, which some argue contradicts the populist agenda he promoted during his campaign[5]. Despite these contradictions, Trump's populist narrative has had a significant impact on American politics, mobilizing a substantial base of supporters and influencing the Republican Party's direction[2][4].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.oah.org/tah/february-2/if-trump-and-sanders-are-both-populists-what-does-populist-mean/" target="_blank">https://www.oah.org/tah/february-2/if-trump-and-sanders-are-both-populists-what-does-populist-mean/</a><br>

 <br><br><a href=".?query=tag:Trump" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Trump</a> <br>Here are the key points about Trump's actions regarding the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and mail-in voting:<br>
<br>Trump openly admitted to blocking funding for the USPS to hinder mail-in voting for the 2020 election. He stated that without the additional $25 billion in funding requested by Democrats, the Postal Service would struggle to handle the expected surge in mail-in ballots[4][5].
<br>The Trump administration made several changes to USPS operations, including:

<br>Appointing Louis DeJoy, a Trump supporter and Republican fundraiser, as Postmaster General[3].
<br>Implementing organizational restructuring and cost-cutting measures that led to mail delivery slowdowns[3].
<br>Removing mail-sorting machines and mailboxes in some areas[2].


<br>These actions were widely criticized as attempts to undermine mail-in voting and the electoral process:

<br>Democrats accused Trump of voter suppression and attacking democracy[4].
<br>Experts warned that these changes could disenfranchise voters, particularly those relying on mail-in ballots due to the COVID-19 pandemic[2][4].


<br>Trump repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting would lead to widespread voter fraud[4][5].
<br>The controversy surrounding USPS funding became a major point of contention in negotiations for COVID-19 relief packages[3][5].
<br>In response to public outcry and legal challenges, DeJoy announced the suspension of many of his reform initiatives until after the 2020 election[2].
<br>Critics argued that Trump's actions were designed to cast doubt on the integrity of the election process and potentially set the stage for challenging the results if he lost[2].
<br>These events highlighted the politicization of the USPS and raised concerns about the impact on voting rights and the democratic process in the United States.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.justsecurity.org/72132/the-trump-administration-and-the-u-s-postal-service-a-timeline/" target="_blank">https://www.justsecurity.org/72132/the-trump-administration-and-the-u-s-postal-service-a-timeline/</a><br>

<br>Chief Diplomat: Conducts foreign policy, negotiates treaties (subject to Senate approval), and appoints ambassadors.
<br>Legislative Leader: Proposes legislation, signs bills into law, or vetoes them. The president also addresses Congress on the State of the Union.

<br>Political Party Leader: Supports party candidates and shapes the party's agenda.
<br>National Security Leader: Oversees national security decisions and appoints key officials in this area.

<br>COVID-19 Response: Implemented the American Rescue Plan, which included $1.9 trillion in economic relief, direct payments to individuals, extended unemployment benefits, and funding for vaccine distribution, helping to administer over 500 million vaccinations[1][2].
<br>Gun Violence Prevention: Signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, enhancing background checks, closing the "boyfriend" loophole, and funding youth mental health[1].
<br>Climate Change: Made a $369 billion investment in climate change through the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest in American history, and rejoined the Paris Agreement[1][2].
<br>Healthcare: Allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capped prescription drug costs for seniors, and expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies, reducing the number of uninsured Americans[1][2][3][5].
<br>Economic Recovery: Achieved historic job growth, with 6.6 million jobs created in one year, and reduced unemployment rates post-pandemic[1][2].
<br>Education and Child Poverty: Provided significant college debt relief and cut child poverty in half through the American Rescue Plan[1].

While Trump has not achieved the level of authoritarian control exercised by dictators like Hitler or Mussolini, there are concerning parallels in his language and approach[1][4][5].<br>Key similarities include:<br>
<br>Dehumanizing language: Trump has referred to his political opponents as "vermin" and called for them to be "rooted out," echoing rhetoric used by Hitler and Mussolini to vilify their enemies[4][5]. This type of language serves to dehumanize opponents and justify harsh treatment against them.
<br>Portraying internal enemies as the greatest threat: Trump has emphasized that the "real threat" comes from within the country rather than external forces, similar to Hitler's focus on internal enemies[4]. This framing can be used to justify crackdowns on dissent.
<br>Encouraging violence among supporters: Trump has at times appeared to endorse or hint at violent responses from his supporters against protesters or opponents, reminiscent of tactics used by dictators like Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe[3].
<br>Attacking the press: Trump's hostility towards media criticism mirrors the approach of regimes in countries like Russia and Egypt, where journalists face severe repercussions for criticizing the government[3].
<br>Threatening retribution: Trump has suggested the possibility of retribution against political enemies if he returns to power, a common tactic among autocratic leaders[5].
<br>Using nativist and xenophobic rhetoric: Trump's comments about immigrants "poisoning the blood" of the country have drawn comparisons to Hitler's language about racial purity[4].
<br>However, there are important distinctions:<br>
<br>Institutional constraints: Unlike historical dictators, Trump operates within a system of democratic institutions and checks and balances that limit his ability to consolidate power[3].
<br>Freedom of press: Despite Trump's attacks on the media, the U.S. still maintains a free press that can criticize the government without fear of violent reprisal, unlike in truly authoritarian regimes[3].
<br>Democratic processes: Trump has participated in democratic elections and left office after losing, unlike dictators who typically maintain power through force or rigged elections.
<br>Scale of actions: While Trump's rhetoric is concerning, he has not engaged in the level of violent suppression, mass incarceration, or genocide associated with infamous dictators.
<br>It's important to note that while the parallels in rhetoric are alarming to many historians and critics, Trump and his supporters reject these comparisons as overblown or politically motivated[5]. The debate over these comparisons reflects broader concerns about the state of democracy and political discourse in the United States.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/19/1220443867/trump-s-rhetoric-is-drawing-alarming-comparisons-to-autocratic-leaders-and-dicta" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/2023/12/19/1220443867/trump-s-rhetoric-is-drawing-alarming-comparisons-to-autocratic-leaders-and-dicta</a><br>

<br>GDP Growth: Since World War II, real GDP has grown about 1.6 times faster under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents. This trend holds regardless of the starting point of the analysis, whether it begins with Presidents Truman, Kennedy, or Reagan[1][4][5].
<br>Employment and Wages<br>
<br>Job Creation: Nonfarm employment has increased at a significantly higher rate under Democratic administrations. Businesses have added jobs at nearly 2.5 times the rate under Democrats compared to Republicans[1][4]. 
<br>Wage Growth: Real wage growth for production and nonsupervisory workers has been substantially higher under Democratic presidents. From 1980 through 2019, these workers saw real wage increases that were 40 times greater annually under Democrats than under Republicans[2].
<br>Stock Market Performance<br>
<br>Stock Market Returns: The S&amp;P 500 has averaged an annual gain of 11.2% during Democratic presidencies, compared to 6.9% under Republican presidencies. This pattern is consistent across various analyses and time frames[1][4].
<br>Corporate Profits<br>
<br>Corporate Earnings: Corporate profits, measured by earnings per share, have grown more robustly under Democratic presidents, averaging 12.8% compared to 1.8% under Republicans[1].
<br>Unemployment and Recessions<br>
<br>Unemployment Rate: The unemployment rate has typically fallen under Democratic presidents and risen under Republican presidents. Additionally, ten of the eleven U.S. recessions between 1953 and 2020 began under Republican administrations[1].
<br>Recessions: Major economic recessions, including the Great Recession, began under Republican presidents, with the notable exception of the pandemic-induced recession under Trump[2].
<br>Public Perception vs. Reality<br>
Despite the data favoring Democratic economic performance, public opinion often rates Republicans higher in economic management. This discrepancy may be due to various factors, including messaging and public perception[2][3].<br>Conclusion<br>
Overall, the data indicate that Americans have fared better economically under Democratic presidents across a range of metrics, although the reasons for this disparity are complex and not entirely attributable to policy choices alone[1][2][3][4][5].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._economic_performance_by_presidential_party" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._economic_performance_by_presidential_party</a><br>

 <br><br><a href=".?query=tag:Trump" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Trump</a> <a href=".?query=tag:tax-cuts" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#tax-cuts</a> <br>Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 had a significant impact on income inequality in the United States:<br>
<br>Disproportionate benefits: The tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthiest individuals and large corporations. The richest 1% of Americans received substantial tax cuts, averaging around $41,000 annually, while the bottom 60% of households received only about $500 on average[1][5].
<br>Corporate tax cuts: The law reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, boosting after-tax profits for corporations. However, this did not translate into widespread wage increases or job growth for ordinary workers as promised[1][4].
<br>Pass-through income deduction: The TCJA introduced a 20% deduction for pass-through business income, which also primarily benefited high-income individuals[5].
<br>Long-term effects: Analyses suggest that the TCJA will have a long-term effect of making the distribution of after-tax income more unequal[1][4].
<br>Revenue loss: The tax cuts led to a substantial decrease in federal revenue, limiting the government's ability to invest in programs that could have mitigated income inequality[4].
<br>Widening wealth gap: As more money flowed upward due to these tax cuts, the gap in accumulated wealth widened. By 2019, the top 10% of Americans had three times the wealth of everyone else in the country combined[1].
<br>In summary, the TCJA under Trump significantly worsened income inequality by providing substantial tax benefits to the wealthy and corporations, while offering minimal relief to lower- and middle-income households. The promised economic benefits, such as increased wages and job growth, largely failed to materialize for the average worker[1][4][5].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/unequal-burden/how-four-decades-of-tax-cuts-fueled-inequality/" target="_blank">https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/unequal-burden/how-four-decades-of-tax-cuts-fueled-inequality/</a><br>

 <br><br><a href=".?query=tag:minimum-wage" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#minimum-wage</a> <br>The impact of raising the minimum wage on the economy is a subject of considerable debate, with arguments both for and against it.<br>Arguments For Raising the Minimum Wage<br>
<br>Improved Standard of Living: Higher wages can enhance the living standards of low-wage workers, helping them cope with the rising cost of living[2].
<br>Economic Stimulus: Increased wages can boost consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth by increasing demand for goods and services[2].
<br>Reduction in Poverty: Raising the minimum wage can lift many individuals and families out of poverty, reducing the need for federal and state financial aid programs[4].
<br>Employee Morale and Retention: Higher wages can improve employee morale and productivity, leading to better employee retention and reduced hiring and training costs for businesses[2].
<br>Arguments Against Raising the Minimum Wage<br>
<br>Inflation: Critics argue that raising the minimum wage can lead to higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass on the increased labor costs to consumers, potentially negating the benefits of higher wages[1][2].
<br>Job Losses: There is concern that higher minimum wages could lead to job cuts, as businesses may reduce their workforce to maintain profitability. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a $15 minimum wage could result in up to 1.9 million job losses by 2032[2][5].
<br>Impact on Small Businesses: Small businesses, particularly those already struggling due to economic downturns like the COVID-19 pandemic, may be disproportionately affected by higher labor costs, potentially leading to closures and further job losses[5].
<br>Increased Competition for Jobs: A higher minimum wage might attract overqualified workers to low-wage positions, making it harder for young or inexperienced workers to find jobs and gain experience[2].
<br>Conclusion<br>The effects of raising the minimum wage on the economy are complex and multifaceted. While it can improve the standard of living for many low-wage workers and stimulate economic growth, it also carries risks such as potential job losses and inflation. The overall impact depends on various factors, including the specific economic context and the magnitude of the wage increase.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052815/does-raising-minimum-wage-increase-inflation.asp" target="_blank">https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052815/does-raising-minimum-wage-increase-inflation.asp</a><br>

This means the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged at $7.25 for 15 years, marking the longest period without an increase since the establishment of the minimum wage in the United States in 1938[1].<br>Some key points about the federal minimum wage:<br>
<br>The $7.25 per hour rate has been in effect since July 24, 2009[1][2][3].
<br>This 15-year period without an increase is the longest stretch since the minimum wage was first established in 1938[1].
<br>During this time, the purchasing power of the dollar has declined, and prices for everyday items have increased significantly[1].
<br>In 2023, approximately 869,000 American workers earned the federal minimum wage or less[1].
<br>The federal minimum wage is currently in effect in 20 states, primarily in the Southern and Midwestern regions of the U.S.[1]
<br>Many states and localities have established higher minimum wages than the federal rate in response to the lack of federal increases[1][3].
<br>Despite efforts to raise the federal minimum wage, including recent proposals like the Raise the Wage Act of 2023, which aims to gradually increase it to $17 per hour by 2028, there have been no successful federal increases since 2009[2].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/24/nx-s1-5050573/federal-minimum-wage-increase-15-year-anniversary" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/2024/07/24/nx-s1-5050573/federal-minimum-wage-increase-15-year-anniversary</a><br>

<br>Under Trump: Wages for rank-and-file workers rose 15.4% during his term, outpacing inflation. This helped people feel they were getting ahead financially.
<br>Under Biden: Wages have grown faster in absolute terms (15% for private-industry workers between Q1 2021 and Q1 2024) compared to Trump's tenure (9.4% between Q1 2017 and Q1 2020).
<br>However, under Biden, wage growth has barely kept up with inflation. The 19% jump in prices during Biden's term has largely offset wage gains, making many workers feel like they're not getting ahead.
<br>Despite this, wage inequality has decreased under Biden, with lower-income workers receiving higher raises that kept up more with price increases.
<br>In summary, while wages grew under both presidents, workers generally felt better off under Trump due to lower inflation, even though Biden's presidency has seen faster nominal wage growth and reduced wage inequality.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.vox.com/politics/356775/trump-biden-debate-truth-about-biden-record" target="_blank">https://www.vox.com/politics/356775/trump-biden-debate-truth-about-biden-record</a><br>

<br>No new wars: Trump is noted for not starting any new full-scale wars, making him the first president since Jimmy Carter to do so[1][3][4].
<br>Military actions: While Trump did not start new wars, he did engage in significant military actions, including:

<br>Ordering airstrikes on Syrian military facilities in response to chemical weapon attacks[1][3].
<br>Authorizing the drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani[1][3].
<br>Continuing military operations against ISIS and other terrorist groups[3][4].


<br>Troop withdrawals: Trump campaigned on ending "endless wars" and took steps to reduce U.S. military presence abroad:

<br>He initiated the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and began winding down deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq[2][5].


<br>Foreign policy: Trump's foreign policy was characterized by a mix of isolationism and robust military posturing. He threatened military action against North Korea but also engaged in unprecedented diplomatic efforts with its leader, Kim Jong-un[5].
<br>In summary, while Trump did not start any new wars, he maintained and escalated certain military operations and took significant military actions during his presidency.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fact-check-which-us-presidents-led-the-nation-into-new-wars-idUSKBN2A22QR/" target="_blank">https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fact-check-which-us-presidents-led-the-nation-into-new-wars-idUSKBN2A22QR/</a><br>

<br>Trump received four student deferments while attending college between 1964 and 1968.
<br>After graduating, he received a medical deferment in 1968 for bone spurs in his heels.
<br>This medical deferment changed his draft classification from 1-A (available for unrestricted military service) to 1-Y (qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency).
<br>In 1972, his classification was changed to 4-F (not qualified for military service).
<br>Trump has faced criticism and controversy over these deferments, particularly the medical one, with some questioning its legitimacy.
<br>He never served in the military and was not drafted for the Vietnam War.
<br>While Trump's actions were legal under the draft system at the time, critics have characterized them as draft dodging, especially in light of his later hawkish statements on military matters.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-draft-executive-order-trump-would-seek-to-limit-protections-for-social-media-companies-11590637554" target="_blank">https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-draft-executive-order-trump-would-seek-to-limit-protections-for-social-media-companies-11590637554</a><br>

In response, Israel declared war on Hamas and began a massive bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip, followed by a ground invasion[1][3].<br>Key points about the current situation:<br>
<br>Casualties: Over 1,300 Israelis and 10,000 Palestinians were killed in the first month of fighting alone[1].
<br>Humanitarian crisis: Israel imposed a "total blockade" on Gaza, cutting off food, fuel, and other essential supplies[3].
<br>Displacement: Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced within Gaza[1].
<br>International response: The US and Western allies have supported Israel, while Russia and China have refused to condemn Hamas[2].
<br>Ongoing conflict: Fighting continues, with Israel vowing "mighty vengeance" and fears of a prolonged ground invasion growing[3].
<br>Historical context: This latest escalation is part of a long-standing conflict dating back to the early 20th century, centered on competing claims to the same land[4].
<br>The situation remains highly volatile, with significant loss of life on both sides and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza[5].<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/israeli-palestinian-conflict</a><br>

Here are the key points:<br>
<br>Release of Frozen Assets: The $150 billion figure often cited refers to the estimated value of Iranian assets that were unfrozen as part of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers, including the U.S. These were Iran's own assets, not a direct payment from the U.S. government[1].
<br>Actual Amounts: The actual accessible assets were significantly lower, with estimates ranging from $29 billion to $56 billion, depending on their liquidity and usability[1].
<br>Indirect Effects: While the release of these funds potentially increased Iran's financial capacity, there is no direct evidence that the Obama administration's actions were intended to, or directly resulted in, increased Iranian support for Hamas. The JCPOA aimed to curb Iran's nuclear activities and involved multiple countries, not just the U.S.[1].
<br>Iran's Support for Hamas: Iran has long supported Hamas through financial aid, weapons, and training. This support has been consistent over the years, independent of the JCPOA. Estimates suggest that Iran provides Hamas with $70 million to $100 million annually[2][3][4][5].
<br>In summary, the Obama administration's actions under the JCPOA did not directly fund Hamas. The funds released were Iran's own assets, and while these may have indirectly bolstered Iran's capacity to support groups like Hamas, attributing direct responsibility to the Obama administration is inaccurate.<br><br>[1] <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/us-give-iran-150-billion-barack-obama-jack-posobiec-1835083" target="_blank">https://www.newsweek.com/us-give-iran-150-billion-barack-obama-jack-posobiec-1835083</a><br>
