#### Q. Does Trump want the United States to withdraw from NATO?

#NATO #Trump 

Trump's stance on NATO is complex:

1. He has repeatedly criticized NATO and expressed frustration with the alliance, famously saying "I don't give a shit about NATO"[3].
2. He has consistently pressured NATO allies to increase their defense spending, viewing many European countries as not paying their fair share[2][4].
3. While president, Trump reportedly discussed pulling the U.S. out of NATO multiple times, but was talked out of it by advisers[1][3].
4. In a recent interview, Trump stated he would "100 percent" remain in NATO if European countries "play fair" and increase their financial contributions[5].
5. However, experts and former officials, like John Bolton, warn that in a potential second term, Trump might seriously pursue withdrawal from NATO[2][3].
6. Trump's recent comments suggesting he wouldn't defend NATO allies who don't meet spending targets have reignited concerns about his commitment to the alliance[2][4].

In summary, while Trump has not explicitly stated he wants to withdraw from NATO, his actions and statements suggest he is deeply skeptical of the alliance and might consider withdrawal if European allies don't meet his demands for increased spending.

The biggest threats to the United States, according to various assessments, include:

2. **Russia**: Russia remains a primary threat, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. Its invasion of Ukraine, nuclear arsenal, and disruptive activities in other regions pose significant risks to U.S. interests[1][2][5].
