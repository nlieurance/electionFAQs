#### Q. What's this about Trump and the Census?

#Trump 

Here are the key points about Trump's attempts to influence the 2020 U.S. Census:

1. The Trump administration made unprecedented efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census[1][2]. This was seen as an attempt to suppress responses from immigrant communities and alter the population counts used for congressional apportionment[3].
2. In July 2019, the Supreme Court blocked the addition of the citizenship question, ruling that the administration's stated reasoning for adding it "seems to have been contrived"[4].
3. After failing to add the citizenship question, Trump issued an executive order in July 2019 instructing federal agencies to share citizenship data with the Census Bureau[3][4].
4. In July 2020, Trump issued a memorandum seeking to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the census population counts used for congressional apportionment[2][3]. This was unprecedented, as all persons regardless of citizenship status had been included in these counts since 1790[3].
5. The Trump administration also tried to cut the census count short and speed up the delivery of results, which was seen as an attempt to control the apportionment process before leaving office if Trump lost reelection[5].
6. ==Internal documents revealed that the push for citizenship data was part of a secret strategy to alter the population numbers used for congressional apportionment and Electoral College votes in ways that would likely benefit Republicans[4].==
7. Career officials at the Census Bureau raised concerns about the "unprecedented" level of engagement from political appointees in technical matters related to the census[5].

These actions were widely criticized as attempts to manipulate the census for political gain, potentially undermining its constitutional purpose of counting all persons in the United States[1][3][4].
