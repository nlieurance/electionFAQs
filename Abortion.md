#pro-life #Trump #pro-choice #Biden 

**Donald Trump's Position on Abortion**

1. **State-Level Decision**: Trump believes abortion rights should be decided by individual states rather than at the federal level[1][3].
2. **Supreme Court Influence**: His appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court were pivotal in overturning Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion[1][2][3].
3. **Federal Ban Stance**: Trump has stated he would not sign a federal abortion ban but supports states imposing their own restrictions[1][3].
4. **Exceptions**: He supports exceptions for abortion in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother's life is at risk[3].

**Joe Biden's Position on Abortion**

1. **Federal Protection**: Biden supports enshrining the right to abortion in federal law, akin to the protections provided by Roe v. Wade before it was overturned[1][2][3].
2. **Legislative Efforts**: He has called for a Democratic majority in Congress to pass laws protecting abortion rights and has pledged to veto any federal abortion ban[1][3].
3. **Administrative Actions**: In the absence of legislative changes, Biden's administration has taken steps to mitigate the impact of state-level abortion bans, such as protecting abortion patients' medical records and ensuring emergency medical treatment includes necessary abortions[1].
4. **Public Advocacy**: Biden has been vocal about restoring Roe v. Wade and has criticized Trump's role in its overturning[3].

Both Trump and Biden have clear, contrasting positions on abortion, reflecting broader ideological divides between their respective parties.
