#### Q. Why was Trump impeached?

#Trump 

Donald Trump was impeached twice during his presidency.

**First Impeachment (December 18, 2019):**
Trump was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress[1][2]. The charges stemmed from a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump allegedly solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election[1][2]. Specifically, Trump was accused of pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rival Joe Biden and allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, while withholding $400 million in military aid to Ukraine[1][2].

**Second Impeachment (January 13, 2021):**
Trump was impeached for incitement of insurrection[3][4]. This impeachment came in the wake of the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol[3][4]. The House of Representatives charged Trump with encouraging his supporters to commit acts of violence at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election[3][4].

==In both cases, Trump was ultimately acquitted by the Senate[1][3][4].== However, he became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice[4]. The second impeachment was also notable for being the most bipartisan impeachment in U.S. history, with 10 House Republicans voting in favor of impeachment[3].
