4. **Political Exploitation:**

**Joe Biden: Evidence of Corruption**

1. **Hunter Biden's Business Dealings:**
   - Allegations have been made regarding Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China, with claims that Joe Biden was involved or benefited. However, investigations have not conclusively proven Joe Biden's direct involvement or corruption.
2. **Republican Investigations:**
   - Congressional Republicans have launched investigations into Biden's actions during his vice presidency, particularly regarding Ukraine. These investigations are ongoing and have yet to produce definitive evidence of corruption.
3. **Public Perception and Political Attacks:**
   - Biden has faced political attacks accusing him of corruption, but these claims often lack substantiated evidence and are part of broader partisan disputes.

**Summary**

While there is substantial evidence and multiple investigations supporting claims of corruption against Donald Trump, including criminal charges and documented unethical business practices, the evidence against Joe Biden primarily revolves around allegations related to his son's business activities, which have not been conclusively proven.
