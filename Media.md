#### Q. Is Fox News a reliable news source?

#Fox-News 

==Fox News is not considered a reliable news source by media experts and researchers[1][2][4].== While it does provide some factual reporting, several studies and analyses have found that Fox News:

1. Skews heavily to the right in its bias[1][4]
2. Engages in selective reporting and omission of information that doesn't align with its partisan stance[3][5]
3. Has viewers who are more likely to hold misconceptions about key political issues compared to viewers of other networks[3]
4. Blurs the line between news and opinion programming[2][5]

Independent media bias assessments rate Fox News as only "Generally Reliable" with analysis and other issues affecting its credibility[4]. The network has also faced legal consequences for knowingly broadcasting false information[2]. While some individual anchors may be more reliable, overall Fox News is not considered a trustworthy source for unbiased, comprehensive news coverage.

#### Q. In what ways has Fox News been critical of Trump?

#Trump #Fox-News 

There are several ways in which Fox News has been critical of Trump or shown a shift in their relationship:

1. **Internal opposition:** Documents revealed through litigation show that top Fox executives, including Rupert Murdoch and board member Paul Ryan, expressed hostility towards Trump after the January 6 attack. Murdoch reportedly aimed to "make Trump a non person" and move on from him[1].
2. **Reduced coverage:** There are indications that Fox News has been giving Trump less airtime and attention. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., claimed he hadn't been invited on the network for six months[1].
3. **Debate coverage:** Fox News is pitching to secure Republican primary debates without specifically mentioning Trump or DeSantis, suggesting a more neutral stance towards candidates[1].
4. **Criticism from Trump allies:** Trump and his supporters have publicly attacked Fox News. Trump called Rupert Murdoch and executives "MAGA hating Globalist RINOS," while others like Stephen K. Bannon have criticized the network[1].
5. **Legal issues coverage**: Fox News legal analysts have at times been critical of Trump's legal situations. For example, some commentators questioned the credibility of key witnesses in Trump's hush money trial[3].
6. **Balanced reporting:** There are instances where Fox News has presented more balanced or critical views of Trump. For example, they aired criticism from "The View" hosts who called Trump's RNC speech "narcissistic" and "xenophobic"[5].

It's important to note that while there are signs of a strained relationship and occasional criticism, Fox News still provides platforms for Trump supporters and positive coverage of the former president[2][4]. The network appears to be navigating a complex balance between its traditional pro-Trump stance and a desire to maintain broader appeal and credibility.
