#### Q. How did the national debt change during the Trump and Biden presidencies?

#Biden #Trump 

**Under Trump:**
- Debt held by the public grew by $7.2 trillion over his full 4-year term.
- Gross federal debt increased by $7.8 trillion during his presidency.

**Under Biden (first 3 years and 5 months):**
- Debt held by the public has grown by $6.0 trillion.
- Gross federal debt has increased by $7.0 trillion.

**As a percentage of GDP:**
- Debt held by the public grew by 23 percentage points under Trump.
- It has remained relatively flat under Biden, largely due to GDP growth and inflation.

Both presidencies saw significant debt increases, with Trump's term seeing a larger total increase, partly due to COVID-19 relief spending in his final year.

#### Q. What is the national debt?

The national debt is the total amount of outstanding borrowing by the U.S. Federal Government accumulated over the nation's history[4]. As of July 22, 2024, the U.S. national debt held by the public stands at approximately $27.79 trillion. This debt has reached historic levels relative to the size of the U.S. economy, currently almost equaling the entire U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)[3]. The debt is financed through the issuance of government bonds, which are purchased by investors both domestically and internationally[5].
