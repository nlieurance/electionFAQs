#### Q. How did Trump's tax cuts impact income inequality?

Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 had a significant impact on income inequality in the United States:

1. Disproportionate benefits: The tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthiest individuals and large corporations. The richest 1% of Americans received substantial tax cuts, averaging around $41,000 annually, while the bottom 60% of households received only about $500 on average[1][5].
2. Corporate tax cuts: The law reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, boosting after-tax profits for corporations. However, this did not translate into widespread wage increases or job growth for ordinary workers as promised[1][4].
3. Pass-through income deduction: The TCJA introduced a 20% deduction for pass-through business income, which also primarily benefited high-income individuals[5].
4. Long-term effects: Analyses suggest that the TCJA will have a long-term effect of making the distribution of after-tax income more unequal[1][4].
5. Revenue loss: The tax cuts led to a substantial decrease in federal revenue, limiting the government's ability to invest in programs that could have mitigated income inequality[4].
6. Widening wealth gap: As more money flowed upward due to these tax cuts, the gap in accumulated wealth widened. By 2019, the top 10% of Americans had three times the wealth of everyone else in the country combined[1].

In summary, the TCJA under Trump significantly worsened income inequality by providing substantial tax benefits to the wealthy and corporations, while offering minimal relief to lower- and middle-income households. The promised economic benefits, such as increased wages and job growth, largely failed to materialize for the average worker[1][4][5].
