#### Q. What is populism?

Populism is a political approach that seeks to represent the interests and voices of ordinary people, often contrasting them against a perceived elite or establishment. It typically emphasizes the idea of a struggle between the common populace and a privileged group, advocating for policies that are claimed to benefit the general public.

#### Q. Is Trump a populist candidate?

#Trump 

Donald Trump is often described as a populist candidate due to his rhetorical style and appeal to the "common people" against the perceived elite. His campaign and presidency featured many hallmarks of populism, such as anti-establishment rhetoric, nationalist sentiments, and promises to prioritize the interests of ordinary Americans over those of elites and foreign entities[1][3][4]. 

However, his actual governance has been critiqued for favoring traditional right-wing policies, such as tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation, which some argue contradicts the populist agenda he promoted during his campaign[5]. Despite these contradictions, Trump's populist narrative has had a significant impact on American politics, mobilizing a substantial base of supporters and influencing the Republican Party's direction[2][4].
