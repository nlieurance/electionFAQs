#Heritage-Foundation #project-2025 #Trump 

Donald Trump is not officially affiliated with the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025. Although the project includes individuals from Trump's orbit and aligns with some of his policy positions, ==Trump has publicly disavowed any involvement==, stating he disagrees with certain aspects of the project and was unaware of its details[2][3][5]. Project 2025 is a collaborative effort led by the Heritage Foundation and over 100 conservative organizations, aiming to provide policy recommendations for the next conservative administration[1][2].

#### Q. What does the ACLU say about Trump's actions regarding civil rights?

#ACLU #Trump 

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has been critical of Donald Trump's actions regarding civil rights during his presidency and potential future administration. Here are some key points from the ACLU's perspective:

1. **Criminal Legal System**: The ACLU has expressed concern over Trump's attempts to exacerbate inequities in the criminal legal system, emphasizing the need to combat these efforts through litigation, advocacy, and community mobilization[1].
2. **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and Anti-Discrimination Law**: The ACLU has criticized Trump's rhetoric on "anti-white racism," which they argue threatens to unravel decades of progress on racial equality and civil rights[2].
3. **Surveillance, Protest, and Free Speech**: The ACLU has outlined potential abuses of executive power in a second Trump administration, including criminalizing dissent, stifling free speech, expanding government surveillance, and targeting political opponents. They have committed to defending First Amendment rights and individual liberties against such threats[3][5].
4. **General Stance**: The ACLU has released a series of memos detailing the implications of a potential second Trump administration on various civil rights issues, including immigration, LGBTQ rights, abortion, and voting rights. They emphasize the importance of standing against any executive actions that threaten civil rights and liberties[4].

Overall, the ACLU views Trump's actions and potential future policies as significant threats to civil rights and has pledged to actively oppose these through legal and advocacy efforts.

#### Q. What does the ACLU say about Biden's presidency?

#ACLU #Biden 

The ACLU has a mixed view of Biden's presidency regarding civil rights and liberties:

1. Progress in some areas:
- Expanded voting rights and abortion protections
- Advocated for equal access for transgender individuals
- Supported students' right to receive an inclusive education
- Issued an executive order promoting access to voting
2. Concerns and unfulfilled promises:
- Failed to fully ban racial and other profiling, especially in national security and border contexts
- Did not end suspicionless surveillance under FISA Section 702
- Has not fully restored the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to its full strength
- Has not ended the federal death penalty as promised during his campaign
- Implemented new asylum restrictions that the ACLU is challenging in court
3. Mixed record on immigration:
- The ACLU sued the Biden administration over new asylum rules that limit asylum processing when border encounters exceed certain thresholds
4. Ongoing challenges:
- The ACLU emphasizes the need to hold a potential second Biden administration accountable for protecting abortion rights, preserving the asylum system, safeguarding voting rights, and reforming the criminal legal system
5. Overall stance:
- While acknowledging some progress, the ACLU believes the Biden administration "has not fulfilled its critical civil rights and civil liberties responsibilities across a range of issues"

The ACLU maintains that it will continue to use litigation, legislation, advocacy, and grassroots mobilization to ensure the protection of civil rights and liberties, regardless of who wins the upcoming election.
