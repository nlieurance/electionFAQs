#### Q. Will raising the minimum wage hurt the economy?

#minimum-wage 

The impact of raising the minimum wage on the economy is a subject of considerable debate, with arguments both for and against it.

**Arguments For Raising the Minimum Wage**

1. **Improved Standard of Living**: Higher wages can enhance the living standards of low-wage workers, helping them cope with the rising cost of living[2].
2. **Economic Stimulus**: Increased wages can boost consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth by increasing demand for goods and services[2].
3. **Reduction in Poverty**: Raising the minimum wage can lift many individuals and families out of poverty, reducing the need for federal and state financial aid programs[4].
4. **Employee Morale and Retention**: Higher wages can improve employee morale and productivity, leading to better employee retention and reduced hiring and training costs for businesses[2].

**Arguments Against Raising the Minimum Wage**

1. **Inflation**: Critics argue that raising the minimum wage can lead to higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass on the increased labor costs to consumers, potentially negating the benefits of higher wages[1][2].
2. **Job Losses**: There is concern that higher minimum wages could lead to job cuts, as businesses may reduce their workforce to maintain profitability. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a $15 minimum wage could result in up to 1.9 million job losses by 2032[2][5].
3. **Impact on Small Businesses**: Small businesses, particularly those already struggling due to economic downturns like the COVID-19 pandemic, may be disproportionately affected by higher labor costs, potentially leading to closures and further job losses[5].
4. **Increased Competition for Jobs**: A higher minimum wage might attract overqualified workers to low-wage positions, making it harder for young or inexperienced workers to find jobs and gain experience[2].

**Conclusion**

The effects of raising the minimum wage on the economy are complex and multifaceted. While it can improve the standard of living for many low-wage workers and stimulate economic growth, it also carries risks such as potential job losses and inflation. The overall impact depends on various factors, including the specific economic context and the magnitude of the wage increase.

#### Q. When is the last time the federal minimum wage went up?

#minimum-wage 

The last time the federal minimum wage increased was on July 24, 2009, when it rose from $6.55 to $7.25 per hour[1][2]. This means the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged at $7.25 for 15 years, marking the longest period without an increase since the establishment of the minimum wage in the United States in 1938[1].

Some key points about the federal minimum wage:

1. The $7.25 per hour rate has been in effect since July 24, 2009[1][2][3].
2. This 15-year period without an increase is the longest stretch since the minimum wage was first established in 1938[1].
3. During this time, the purchasing power of the dollar has declined, and prices for everyday items have increased significantly[1].
4. In 2023, approximately 869,000 American workers earned the federal minimum wage or less[1].
5. The federal minimum wage is currently in effect in 20 states, primarily in the Southern and Midwestern regions of the U.S.[1]
6. Many states and localities have established higher minimum wages than the federal rate in response to the lack of federal increases[1][3].

Despite efforts to raise the federal minimum wage, including recent proposals like the Raise the Wage Act of 2023, which aims to gradually increase it to $17 per hour by 2028, there have been no successful federal increases since 2009[2].

#### Q. What happened to wages during the Trump and Biden presidencies?

Based on the search results, here's a brief comparison of wages during the Trump and Biden presidencies:

1. **Under Trump:** Wages for rank-and-file workers rose 15.4% during his term, outpacing inflation. This helped people feel they were getting ahead financially.
2. **Under Biden**: Wages have grown faster in absolute terms (15% for private-industry workers between Q1 2021 and Q1 2024) compared to Trump's tenure (9.4% between Q1 2017 and Q1 2020).
3. However, under Biden, wage growth has barely kept up with inflation. The 19% jump in prices during Biden's term has largely offset wage gains, making many workers feel like they're not getting ahead.
4. Despite this, wage inequality has decreased under Biden, with lower-income workers receiving higher raises that kept up more with price increases.

In summary, while wages grew under both presidents, workers generally felt better off under Trump due to lower inflation, even though Biden's presidency has seen faster nominal wage growth and reduced wage inequality.
