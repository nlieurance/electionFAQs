#### Q. Was Donald Trump really the first president since Jimmy Carter not to start a war?

#Trump #Carter 

Donald Trump did not start any new wars during his presidency. Here are the key points:

1. **No new wars**: Trump is noted for not starting any new full-scale wars, making him the first president since Jimmy Carter to do so[1][3][4].
2. **Military actions**: While Trump did not start new wars, he did engage in significant military actions, including:
   - Ordering airstrikes on Syrian military facilities in response to chemical weapon attacks[1][3].
   - Authorizing the drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani[1][3].
   - Continuing military operations against ISIS and other terrorist groups[3][4].
3. **Troop withdrawals**: Trump campaigned on ending "endless wars" and took steps to reduce U.S. military presence abroad:
   - He initiated the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and began winding down deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq[2][5].
4. **Foreign policy**: Trump's foreign policy was characterized by a mix of isolationism and robust military posturing. He threatened military action against North Korea but also engaged in unprecedented diplomatic efforts with its leader, Kim Jong-un[5].

In summary, while Trump did not start any new wars, he maintained and escalated certain military operations and took significant military actions during his presidency.

#### Q. Did Donald Trump dodge the draft?

#Trump 

Donald Trump received multiple deferments from military service during the Vietnam War era:

1. Trump received four student deferments while attending college between 1964 and 1968.
2. After graduating, he received a medical deferment in 1968 for bone spurs in his heels.
3. This medical deferment changed his draft classification from 1-A (available for unrestricted military service) to 1-Y (qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency).
4. In 1972, his classification was changed to 4-F (not qualified for military service).
5. Trump has faced criticism and controversy over these deferments, particularly the medical one, with some questioning its legitimacy.
6. He never served in the military and was not drafted for the Vietnam War.

While Trump's actions were legal under the draft system at the time, critics have characterized them as draft dodging, especially in light of his later hawkish statements on military matters.

#### Q. What's going on with Israel and Palestine?

#Israel #Hamas

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has escalated dramatically since October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on southern Israel, killing over 1,400 Israelis and taking over 240 hostages[1][4]. In response, Israel declared war on Hamas and began a massive bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip, followed by a ground invasion[1][3].

Key points about the current situation:

1. Casualties: Over 1,300 Israelis and 10,000 Palestinians were killed in the first month of fighting alone[1].
2. Humanitarian crisis: Israel imposed a "total blockade" on Gaza, cutting off food, fuel, and other essential supplies[3].
3. Displacement: Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced within Gaza[1].
4. International response: The US and Western allies have supported Israel, while Russia and China have refused to condemn Hamas[2].
5. Ongoing conflict: Fighting continues, with Israel vowing "mighty vengeance" and fears of a prolonged ground invasion growing[3].
6. Historical context: This latest escalation is part of a long-standing conflict dating back to the early 20th century, centered on competing claims to the same land[4].

The situation remains highly volatile, with significant loss of life on both sides and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza[5].

#### Q. Did Obama give money to Iran was they used to support Hamas?

#Obama #Iran #Israel #Hamas 

The claim that the Obama administration directly facilitated Iran's aid to Hamas through the release of $150 billion is misleading and lacks factual basis. Here are the key points:

1. **Release of Frozen Assets**: The $150 billion figure often cited refers to the estimated value of Iranian assets that were unfrozen as part of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers, including the U.S. These were Iran's own assets, not a direct payment from the U.S. government[1].
2. **Actual Amounts**: The actual accessible assets were significantly lower, with estimates ranging from $29 billion to $56 billion, depending on their liquidity and usability[1].
3. **Indirect Effects**: While the release of these funds potentially increased Iran's financial capacity, there is no direct evidence that the Obama administration's actions were intended to, or directly resulted in, increased Iranian support for Hamas. The JCPOA aimed to curb Iran's nuclear activities and involved multiple countries, not just the U.S.[1].
4. **Iran's Support for Hamas**: Iran has long supported Hamas through financial aid, weapons, and training. This support has been consistent over the years, independent of the JCPOA. Estimates suggest that Iran provides Hamas with $70 million to $100 million annually[2][3][4][5].

In summary, the Obama administration's actions under the JCPOA did not directly fund Hamas. The funds released were Iran's own assets, and while these may have indirectly bolstered Iran's capacity to support groups like Hamas, attributing direct responsibility to the Obama administration is inaccurate.
