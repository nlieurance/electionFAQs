#### Q. What presidential candidate do environmental groups favor and why?

#Biden 

Environmental groups, including the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund, NextGen PAC, NRDC Action Fund, and the Sierra Club, favor President Joe Biden for re-election. These groups endorse Biden due to his administration's significant progress on climate action, environmental justice, and clean energy initiatives. They highlight Biden's historic climate legislation, his rejoining of the Paris Climate Agreement, and the establishment of the National Climate Task Force as key reasons for their support. These organizations believe that Biden's policies are driving a clean energy transition and advancing environmental justice, making him ==the most pro-climate action president in U.S. history==[1][2].

#### Q. Are electric vehicles (EVs) actually better for the environment?

#EVs 

Yes, electric vehicles are generally better for the environment than traditional gasoline-powered cars, for several key reasons:

1. **Lower emissions:** EVs produce significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime compared to gas vehicles, even when accounting for electricity generation. A medium-sized EV produces 60-68% fewer lifetime greenhouse gas emissions than a gas-powered car[1].
2. **Improved air quality**: EVs have zero tailpipe emissions, reducing local air pollution from nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulate matter[3].
3. **Reduced noise pollution:** Electric vehicles are much quieter than gas-powered cars, helping to decrease noise pollution in urban areas[3].
4. **Less harmful fluids:** EVs don't require motor oil changes or other toxic fluids associated with gas engines, reducing the risk of environmental contamination[2].
5. **Lower brake dust:** Regenerative braking systems in EVs reduce brake dust emissions, which contribute to air pollution[2].
6. **Potential for cleaner energy sources**: As electricity grids incorporate more renewable energy, the environmental benefits of EVs will continue to increase[1][3].

While there are some environmental concerns related to battery production and disposal, the overall impact of EVs is still significantly better than that of gas-powered vehicles. As battery technology improves and recycling processes advance, these concerns are likely to diminish further[4].
