#### Q. Why didn't Donald Trump try to put Hillary Clinton in prison?

#Trump #Hillary-Clinton #lock-her-up 

Despite his campaign rhetoric, Trump did not pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton after becoming president for several reasons:

1. **Change in stance:** Shortly after winning the election, Trump shifted his position, stating he didn't want to "hurt the Clintons" and that Clinton had "suffered greatly"[1][3].
2. **Focus on other priorities:** Trump indicated he wanted to concentrate on issues like jobs, healthcare, and immigration rather than prosecuting Clinton[3].
3. **Potential political backlash:** Prosecuting a political opponent could have been seen as an abuse of power and faced significant opposition[4].
4. **Legal advice:** It was reported that Trump was dissuaded from taking legal action by White House counsel, who warned of potential consequences[4].
5. **Healing and unity:** Trump's team framed the decision as an effort to help Clinton "heal" and potentially promote unity after a divisive election[1][3].
6. **Recognition of Justice Department independence:** There was acknowledgment that the president shouldn't direct specific investigations, as it would violate the Justice Department's independence[4].

#### Q. Does Trump want to punish his political rivals? Has he ever done so?

#Trump 

Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed intentions to punish his political rivals and has a history of attempting to use government power against perceived opponents:

1. Trump has explicitly threatened to imprison political opponents if he returns to office. He stated it's "very possible" he would have to imprison his rivals, saying "It's a terrible, terrible path they're leading us to, and it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them."[1]
2. Trump has made numerous threats on social media to use federal agencies like the FBI and Department of Justice to target Joe Biden and other political enemies if he wins a second term. An analysis found at least 25 such threats against Biden alone since 2023, including promises of FBI raids, investigations, indictments and jail time.[3]
3. During his presidency, Trump reportedly attempted to use government powers against perceived enemies:
- He allegedly asked his chief of staff to have the IRS and other agencies harass FBI officials who investigated his 2016 campaign.[2]
- He reportedly wanted to have political opponents like Hillary Clinton and John Brennan audited or investigated.[2]
- His administration launched an antitrust investigation into auto companies that opposed his fuel efficiency rollbacks.[2]
- He allegedly tried to interfere with the AT&T-Time Warner merger as punishment for CNN's coverage.[2]
4. Trump has vowed to "root out" and prosecute political opponents he labels as "communists, Marxists, fascists and radical-left thugs", referring to them as "vermin".[2]
5. He has threatened to prosecute nonprofits and charities supporting immigrants, accusing them of human trafficking.[3]

While some of Trump's most extreme threats were not carried out during his presidency, often due to resistance from officials, ==he has promised to install more compliant personnel in a potential second term== to execute his agenda more effectively.[2][4] These statements and past actions indicate a clear intention to use government power to punish political rivals if given the opportunity.
