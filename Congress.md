#### Q. Has Biden been able to work with Congress to get things done?

#Biden #executive-orders 

President Joe Biden has had mixed success working with Congress to achieve his legislative goals. Early in his term, Biden was able to pass significant legislation, such as the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law in November 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, leveraging a unified government where Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress[2]. These achievements demonstrate that Biden has been able to work with Congress effectively when his party holds the majority.

However, Biden has faced considerable challenges in passing other parts of his agenda due to a divided Congress and internal party fractures. For example, his "Build Back Better" infrastructure bill had to be significantly watered down to secure the votes of Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema[2]. Additionally, after the midterm elections, Biden encountered a divided government with Republicans controlling the House, making it more difficult to pass new legislation[2].

In response to these challenges, Biden, like his predecessor Donald Trump, has increasingly relied on executive actions to implement his policy goals. This includes a range of regulatory actions such as banning most noncompete agreements, directing federal agencies to purchase sustainable products, and closing the "gun show loophole"[3]. These actions highlight Biden's strategy of using executive power to circumvent legislative gridlock.

Overall, while Biden has achieved some legislative successes with Congress, his ability to pass new laws has been hampered by political polarization and a divided government, leading him to rely more on executive orders and regulatory actions to advance his policy agenda[1][2][3].
