#Trump #Biden 

Here are the key differences between Biden and Trump regarding healthcare policy:

1. Affordable Care Act (ACA/Obamacare):
   - Biden strongly supports the ACA and has worked to expand it, increasing funding for advertising and navigator programs.
   - Trump tried to repeal the ACA during his presidency and reduced federal support for state marketplaces.
2. Health insurance coverage:
   - Under Biden, ACA enrollment has reached record highs, with over 21 million people enrolled nationwide.
   - Under Trump, ACA enrollment declined each year.
3. Prescription drug prices:
   - Biden passed legislation allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors.
   - Trump supported drug importation from Canada but made limited progress on reducing prices.
4. Abortion and transgender health:
   - Biden opposes state abortion bans and restrictions on gender-affirming care.
   - Trump takes credit for overturning Roe v. Wade and has proposed limiting access to gender transition procedures.
5. Overall approach:
   - Biden favors incremental expansion of public programs like Medicaid, ACA, and Medicare.
   - Trump and conservative Republicans advocate for reducing the federal role in healthcare and increasing state and market choices.
6. Areas of agreement:
   - Both support the No Surprises Act to protect patients from unexpected medical bills.
   - Both advocate for price transparency in healthcare.
7. Future plans:
   - Biden's focus is on expanding existing policies and programs.
   - Trump's specific healthcare plans for a potential second term remain vague, with limited policy details provided.

The key distinction is that Biden aims to build on and expand existing federal healthcare programs, while Trump's approach leans towards deregulation and reducing the federal government's role in healthcare.
