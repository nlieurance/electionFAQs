Yes, Donald Trump did call for terminating the Constitution of the United States. Here are the key points:

1. In December 2022, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social suggesting the termination of the Constitution in response to his claims of election fraud[1][4].
2. ==Trump wrote: "A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution"[1][4].==
3. This statement was made in the context of Trump's continued false claims about the 2020 election being stolen from him[3][4].
4. Trump's comments drew criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, with the White House calling the remarks "anathema to the soul of our nation"[4].
5. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney denounced Trump's statement, saying "No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution"[4].
6. After facing backlash, Trump attempted to deny that he had called for terminating the Constitution, claiming it was "DISINFORMATION & LIES" spread by the media[5].
7. Despite his denial, Trump's original post explicitly mentioning the "termination" of constitutional articles remained visible on his Truth Social platform[3][4].

This incident highlighted Trump's continued promotion of election denialism and raised concerns about his respect for democratic institutions and the rule of law.
