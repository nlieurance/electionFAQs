#### Q. What happened with Trump and the Postal Service back in 2020?

#Trump 

Here are the key points about Trump's actions regarding the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and mail-in voting:

1. Trump openly admitted to blocking funding for the USPS to hinder mail-in voting for the 2020 election. He stated that without the additional $25 billion in funding requested by Democrats, the Postal Service would struggle to handle the expected surge in mail-in ballots[4][5].
2. The Trump administration made several changes to USPS operations, including:
   - Appointing Louis DeJoy, a Trump supporter and Republican fundraiser, as Postmaster General[3].
   - Implementing organizational restructuring and cost-cutting measures that led to mail delivery slowdowns[3].
   - Removing mail-sorting machines and mailboxes in some areas[2].
3. These actions were widely criticized as attempts to undermine mail-in voting and the electoral process:
   - Democrats accused Trump of voter suppression and attacking democracy[4].
   - Experts warned that these changes could disenfranchise voters, particularly those relying on mail-in ballots due to the COVID-19 pandemic[2][4].
4. Trump repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting would lead to widespread voter fraud[4][5].
5. The controversy surrounding USPS funding became a major point of contention in negotiations for COVID-19 relief packages[3][5].
6. In response to public outcry and legal challenges, DeJoy announced the suspension of many of his reform initiatives until after the 2020 election[2].
7. Critics argued that Trump's actions were designed to cast doubt on the integrity of the election process and potentially set the stage for challenging the results if he lost[2].

These events highlighted the politicization of the USPS and raised concerns about the impact on voting rights and the democratic process in the United States.
